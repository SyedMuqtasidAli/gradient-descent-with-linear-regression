# 🚀 Gradient Descent From Scratch

Welcome to the Gradient Descent From Scratch project! This project involves implementing the gradient descent algorithm from scratch to understand its underlying mechanics and how it helps in setting the correct values for neural network parameters. The implementation is demonstrated in a Jupyter Notebook named `Gradient Descent From Scratch.ipynb`.

## 📋 Introduction
Gradient descent is a technique that helps us set the correct values for neural network parameters. Without gradient descent, networks wouldn't be able to learn how to make predictions from data. This project implements gradient descent from scratch to provide a clear understanding of how it works.

## 🧠 Understanding Gradient Descent
Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used for minimizing the cost function in machine learning models. By iteratively adjusting the parameters in the direction of the negative gradient, the algorithm converges to the minimum of the cost function, thereby improving the model's predictions.
